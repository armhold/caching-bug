== This program demonstrates what I believe to be a bug in ActionController::caches_action



=== Notes
 
1. config/environments/test.rb has been modified with "config.action_controller.perform_caching = true"
2. test runs leave caching files behind in tmp; best to "rm -rf tmp/*" between runs of the suite.
3. When run in succession, "first run" passes; "second run" fails, presumably because caching from the first test fails to save the Cache-Control header.
